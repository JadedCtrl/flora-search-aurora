  "Begin the game’s loop, which executes (henceforthly called) state-functions over and over again
until Hell freezes over and a new king reigns supreme.
Given a list of state-functions, STATES, it will execute the first function.
Each state-function must take at least a single parameter, a matrix of characters. A state-function
should edit this matrix in-place, replacing its elements with characters that will later be printed
to the terminal.
What the state-function returns is pretty important, having different repercussions:
  * NIL       —  The function is removed from STATES, and so the next function in STATES will start
                 getting executed instead.
  * NIL; List —  The function is popped off STATES and the list is used as the new parameters for
                 the next function in STATES.
  * Function  —  The function is pushed to the front of STATES, and so is executed instead of the
                 current function.
  * List      —  The current function (front of STATES) continues to be executed with the given
                 list as a parameters list.
Make note to add a delay w SLEEP to your state functions, or… well, y’know. Your computer will
overheat, or something ¯\_(ツ)_/¯"
