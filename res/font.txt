A Tiled tileset generated from Fira Code Regular⁽¹⁾ printable ASCII characters.
This is (ofc) not used in the game, but is very handy for visualizing the map in Tiled!

Generated thanks to the beautiful program ttf2png⁽²⁾, like so:
	$ ttf2png -r 32,126 -s 15 -l 15 -e -t -o font.png FiraCode-Regular.ttf

Note `-l 15`, which sets the row-length to 15. This is very important!
Flora's engine parses the tiles' character values by calculating the tile's
[15(row - 1) + column].
Could we avoid this, and automatically figure out the row-length? Yeaaa.
Could I be bothered? Nooo.
